What is Pikuli Project?
-----------------------
Pikuli Project is a port of `Sikuli <https://github.com/sikuli/sikuli>`_ tool on python language. This is the library that can automate anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows or Mac without internal API's support. It uses template matching function powered by OpenCV to identify GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application you want to act on.
